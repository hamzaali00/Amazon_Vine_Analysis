## Purpose

## Results

![Vine and Non-Vine Reviews](Resources/vine_reviews.png)

### Vine Reviews
- The total Vine reviews were 47
- 15 of the 47 reviews were 5-stars
- 31.91% of the reviews were 5-stars

### Non-Vine Reviews
- The total non-Vine reviews are 8343
- 4318 of the 8343 reviews were 5-stars
- 51.76% of the reviews were 5-stars

## Summary

Based on the percentage data gathered, I would conclude that there is no positivity bias in the Vine program. 
The percent of 5-stars from Vine reviews is about 20% less than those from Non-Vine reviews.

However, looking at the data overall, I would conclude that the sample size of Vine review data is not large enough to be comparable with the Non-Vine review data.

### Further Analysis

For further analysis, I would perform the same calculations for 1, 2, 3, and 4 star reviews.
